            <p>A completion requirement for becoming an eagle scout is to complete
              a project, the details of which are left open to the scout themselves,
              besides the rules of it being non-profit and it helping someone, the
              scout could make bird houses, clean a stream, or, in my case, build
              garden beds and a bench for a school.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project first began with assembling the beds after planning and
              approval from the school and the troup itself, which we did at out
              house for several hours each day, before painting it and taking it to
              the school. After finishing that, we brought scouts as well as mulch and
              stones, and worked for several more hours in the sun to finish, at the end
              we all had food we had prepared ahead of time for the scouts, and Fritz
              still uses these beds to this day for their outdoor classroom.

            <p>In a high school programming class, we worked on several seperate projects,
              all used in a app maker called App Inventor, which is far more abstract than
              css or html is, but was still a challenge to work with, needing many paths
              and essentially code to finish. The end project was a pong game, which while
              I didn't fully do correctly, I tried to make a two player version instead
              of against each other, but touch senstivity didn't work as intended, but the
              teacher still praised my different approach.
            </p>
            <p>So far in CSET, we did a tech talk about a subject that personally interested us,
              as well as a website which you will be reading right now, and either
              surprised at how one guy could build a whole site without some website
              builder, or disappointed at how it looks or feels, which I hope I can
              fix with css. Either way, it is a brave new frontier and is honestly
              quite scary.
