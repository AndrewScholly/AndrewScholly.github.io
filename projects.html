        <h3>Eagle scout</h3>
        <img src="images/eaglescout" alt="Eagle Scout Image">
        <p>A completion requirement for becoming an eagle scout is to complete
          a project, the details of which are left open to the scout themselves,
          besides the rules of it being non-profit and it helping someone, the
          scout could make bird houses, clean a stream, or, in my case, build
          garden beds and a bench for a school.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project first began with assembling the beds after planning and
          approval from the school and the troup itself, which we did at out
          house for several hours each day, before painting it and taking it to
          the school. After finishing that, we brought scouts as well as mulch and
          stones, and worked for several more hours in the sun to finish, at the end
          we all had food we had prepared ahead of time for the scouts, and Fritz
          still uses these beds to this day for their outdoor classroom.

        <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
        <img src="images/stevens" alt="Stevens Image">
        <p>In a high school programming class, we worked on several seperate projects,
          all used in a app maker called App Inventor, which is far more abstract than
          css or html is, but was still a challenge to work with, needing many paths
          and essentially code to finish. The end project was a pong game, which while
          I didn't fully do correctly, I tried to make a two player version instead
          of against each other, but touch senstivity didn't work as intended, but the
          teacher still praised my different approach.
        </p>
        <p>So far in CSET, we did a tech talk about a subject that personally interested us,
          as well as a website which you will be reading right now, and either
          surprised at how one guy could build a whole site without some website
          builder, or disappointed at how it looks or feels, which I hope I can
          fix with css. Either way, it is a brave new frontier and is honestly
          quite scary.
