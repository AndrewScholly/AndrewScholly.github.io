          <h3>Homework and Life</h3>
          <p>Often, people procrastinate for a while, one reason why I am working
            on finishing this css now instead of waiting until the last minute.
            Doing homework is always disliked for classes someone isn't into,
            and while I may not always enjoy CSET,
            I still get the work done best I can because it is something I need
            to learn to do right before going out into the real world, if I just
            do something I want to do, nobody is going to want to hire me as I
            would just slack off, and distractions can make me lose focus or think
            of something else, often ruining a train of thought.
          </p>
          <p>One example is this html I am currently working on, to finish up before
            going to putting images in, and working to add those in with proper
            links so they don't have errors and just have a blank box as I had issues
            with before, but I internally just want to do it some other time, but
            the css is going to take far longer, and will be far far more difficult,
            meaning doing it now is my best bet, by far.
          </p>
          <p>Finishing some smaller part of the whole is always helpful in the long run,
            especially if that part is integral to doing a proper job with the css,
            and I am hoping I can do a proper job with it so I don't have to return
            to the specific files this are in anytime in the future.
