      <h3>MLP</h3>
      <img src="images/thunder" alt="Orignal Character Image">
      <p>One of my favorite shows for a few years now is my little pony,
        originally for young girls, it formed a fanbase of not only older
        fans of the 80's show, but also newer male and female fans, such
        as myself, who have followed it as well as making our own
        characters and stories around it.
      </p>
      <p>I have created my own character, Thunder Spark, designed to be
        based off my own personality, including my interests and skills,
        as well as my flaws and negative traits, instead of just being
        the best version of me, which doing has been no easy task, as many
        people prefer to have their own character be what they want to be,
        and dream about it, but having a perfect version of yourself is only
        helpful when you can strive to be them.
      </p>
      <p>Many people find the show to be childish and those who like it
        similarly so, and while the orignal audience was the age group of
        young girls, the story being continous and the characters changing
        rather than staying the same basic archetypes like other kids shows
        do. The lessons they learn tend to vary and change, and many mature
        messages such as a new father, grief over parents' death, and even
        self-harm.

      <h3>Legos</h3>
      <img src="images/Legos" alt="Lego Image">
      <p>One of my earliest interests was with Legos, I enjoyed thinking up
        stories and playing them out using the sets I had on hand, or rebuilding
        them in my own way to fit the scene I had thought up.
      </p>
      <p>I continued collecting sets, some older ones I would search for on
        different sites such as Ebay or Amazon, but most would be ones that
        were on the shelves or the online store, often ones that caught my eye
        in the magazines we got and still do get to this day, which show the
        newer lego sets as well as some older ones.
      </p>
      <p>At the moment, my room at home is almost full of Legos, most of which
        are larger and more complex sets such as a Resurgence class star destroyer,
        a large city area, and an exoforce(a giant robot theme)base sitting on top
        of an old toy box. I have continued collecting, although as I have gotten
        older less sets appear different enough for me to cash out money on instead
        of simply building my own version, which tends to be more fun.

      <h3>BCI</h3>
      <img src="images/BCI" alt="Brain Computer Interface Image">
      <p>I have had an interest in brain computer interfaces for a while now,
        a few projects such as my tech talk for CSET and a presentation for
        science fiction studies have led me to a large wealth of information
        about how it could help those with disabilities or without, and given
        me a new admiration for just how powerful the brain is, and surprised me
        at how similar the brain is, at it's core, to a computer, as both use
        electrical signals to send information, which has been used as the main
        way for BCIs to be used in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>Much of the information I have found, such as rats being able to use
        telepathy with BCIs, sight restoration that is completely surgery free,
        and the possibility of a virtual brain simulation in around 20 years.
        Even ideas of a superhuman using a BCI isn't too far off, as once people
        figure out how to make something on the small scale, if it is useful to
        many people or could be, it often is rapidly improved, cell phones being
        an example.
      </p>
      <p>I even created a superhero idea using the basic ideas of a BCI and
        improving it further, where it could use the brain to manipulate how
        certain parts functioned, an example being modifying skin pigment,
        essentially creating a suit without any non-origanic matter.
