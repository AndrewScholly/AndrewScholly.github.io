        you the best code and help you through all the problems
        you may have with coding! See the links below to learn

        <a href="about.html"class="image-wrap-about">I am an energetic, sometimes a little too much so, person who has a lot
          to offer those with the patience to stick by my side. You may call me what
          you want, just don't call me shy!

          <p>I am a fairly new programmer currently,
            working with html and css to create websites
            and code, such as the one used for this very
            page and much more!

          <p>I have a wide variety of interests, always happy to talk about a
            vast amount of topics, and while some may see my interests as childish
            or out there, I stand by them, knowing their value to me and others.
