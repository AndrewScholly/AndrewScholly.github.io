      <section>
        <h3>Scouts</h3>
        <p>Being a scout added and continues to add many advantages when it comes
          to skills, from knowing how to handle more outdoors than just walking
          in a lawn to cut grass, to being able to save someone's life if the
          situation called for it. Becoming one also requires leading a project
          which requires, in my case at least, years of planning and effort to
          pull off, even for something as simple as putting down garden beds and
          a bench for Fritz Elementary School.
        </p>
        <p>While I tended to be a bit annoying to my fellow scouts, and I still
          struggle with impulsive behavior today, I have learned to keep a cool
          head in many situations as well as work with and if needed forgive those
          who I may not have liked in the past, even if I believe they are still
          not very mature people, many could say the same about me, so I know
          it isn't easy to be fully mature.

        <h3>Academics</h3>
        <p>Since my beginning at school, I have discovered an ability to fairly
          easily succeed at most academics, gaining many A's and high B's, not
          able to get into higher classes, except for math, where I got one of
          my only C's in my school career, the lowest grade I have ever gotten.
        </p>
        <p>While I may not like many of the required academic courses I have been
          in, a few have showed up as being useful, although not in the way
          intended, with a cosign math relationship found for animal behavior.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>Coding seems like something that only lonely people do or that is
          incredibly difficult/impossible to do. Neither of which are really true,
          after all with just 2 months of classes I could make this whole site from
          scratch, as well as the future projects I will be doing.
        </p>
        <p>I have gained a very good understanding of html, the terminal, and
          while css is nearly impossible to fully learn, I believe I'm getting
          the base concepts, it just requires some more work with it to fully
          understand it.
