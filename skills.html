            <p>Being a scout added and continues to add many advantages when it comes
              to skills, from knowing how to handle more outdoors than just walking
              in a lawn to cut grass, to being able to save someone's life if the
              situation called for it. Becoming one also requires leading a project
              which requires, in my case at least, years of planning and effort to
              pull off, even for something as simple as putting down garden beds and
              a bench for Fritz Elementary School.
            </p>
            <p>While I tended to be a bit annoying to my fellow scouts, and I still
              struggle with impulsive behavior today, I have learned to keep a cool
              head in many situations as well as work with and if needed forgive those
              who I may not have liked in the past, even if I believe they are still
              not very mature people, many could say the same about me, so I know
              it isn't easy to be fully mature.

            <p>Since my beginning at school, I have discovered an ability to fairly
              easily succeed at most academics, gaining many A's and high B's, not
              able to get into higher classes, except for math, where I got one of
              my only C's in my school career, the lowest grade I have ever gotten.
            </p>
            <p>While I may not like many of the required academic courses I have been
              in, a few have showed up as being useful, although not in the way
              intended, with a cosign math relationship found for animal behavior.

          <p>Coding seems like something that only lonely people do or that is
            incredibly difficult/impossible to do. Neither of which are really true,
            after all with just 2 months of classes I could make this whole site from
            scratch, as well as the future projects I will be doing.
          </p>
          <p>I have gained a very good understanding of html, the terminal, and
            while css is nearly impossible to fully learn, I believe I'm getting
            the base concepts, it just requires some more work with it to fully
            understand it.
