          <div class="right-side">
            <p>My life was mostly normal early on, growing up a
              fairly normal family, both of which had prepared quite well
              for me and my brother. We grew up as one big family, with
              some cute fluffs as well.
            </p>
            <p>We went oversees for as few years due to work, and when we returned
              I started school at Conestoga Valley, at the time requiring a helper
              due to my Aspergers, but by middle school I no longer needed one.

          <p>While I may be fairly young, I still hope to learn and find a career
            path that would make me happy and make a good amount of money
            at the same time. I don't really wish for any kind of real fancy
            place to live or a big yacht or something, all I want is a fun
            job, friends/family who like me and spend time with me, and a
            place I can comfortably live in and spend a decent amount of time in.
          </p>
          <p>For future careers, aside from the current college courses at
            Stevens, I am thinking of possible IT careers, as I've found
            working with people is incredibly more interesting and fun than
            without.

          <div class="left-side">
            <p>After starting middle school, I was surprised at the amount
              of classes and yet how similar it felt to elementary school,
              one possible reason was how I often did things alone then,
              and instead of being split up like groups of friends might be,
              I just went to the next class, learn something for 45 minutes,
              go to next class, wash, rinse, repeat.
            </p>
            <p>After several fairly normal, and frankly, a bit boring years
              of middle school, I headed on to high school, where I,
              like middle school, felt it was quite similar, and even easier
              in some places, such as less classes and the ability to bring
              backpacks wherever, causing the lockers to be rarely used.

            <p>One of my more general achievments is the honour role during
              high school, which I have achievment many times in my many years
              at CV.
            </p>
            <p>Another of my, perhaps the most impressive, was becoming an Eagle
              Scout in 2018, which took several years of work and planning, as well
              as many merit badges, including lifesaving and first aid, as well as
              swimming and space exoloration.
