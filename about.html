      <h3>Early life</h3>
      <img src="images/young" alt="Image as a child">
      <p>My life was mostly normal early on, growing up a
        fairly normal family, both of which had prepared quite well
        for me and my brother. We grew up as one big family, with
        some cute fluffs as well.
      </p>
      <p>We went oversees for as few years due to work, and when we returned
        I started school at Conestoga Valley, at the time requiring a helper
        due to my Aspergers, but by middle school I no longer needed one.

      <h3>Teenage years</h3>
      <img src="images/teen" alt="Teenage Image">
      <p>After starting middle school, I was surprised at the amount
        of classes and yet how similar it felt to elementary school,
        one possible reason was how I often did things alone then,
        and instead of being split up like groups of friends might be,
        I just went to the next class, learn something for 45 minutes,
        go to next class, wash, rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>After several fairly normal, and frankly, a bit boring years
        of middle school, I headed on to high school, where I,
        like middle school, felt it was quite similar, and even easier
        in some places, such as less classes and the ability to bring
        backpacks wherever, causing the lockers to be rarely used.

      <h3>Acomplishments</h3>
      <img src="images/eagle" alt="Eagle scout Image">
      <p>One of my more general achievments is the honour role during
        high school, which I have achievment many times in my many years
        at CV.
      </p>
      <p>Another of my, perhaps the most impressive, was becoming an Eagle
        Scout in 2018, which took several years of work and planning, as well
        as many merit badges, including lifesaving and first aid, as well as
        swimming and space exoloration.

        <h3>Future plans</h3>
        <img src="images/future" alt="Future Image">
        <p>While I may be fairly young, I still hope to learn and find a career
          path that would make me happy and make a good amount of money
          at the same time. I don't really wish for any kind of real fancy
          place to live or a big yacht or something, all I want is a fun
          job, friends/family who like me and spend time with me, and a
          place I can comfortably live in and spend a decent amount of time in.
        </p>
        <p>For future careers, aside from the current college courses at
          Stevens, I am thinking of possible IT careers, as I've found
          working with people is incredibly more interesting and fun than
          without.
